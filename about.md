Who me?

### My username's Airizse, nice to meet you!

I study Business Information Systems somwhere in the world.
I started to draw in a more "serious" manner when I saw my first anime on TV. I was about, 5 years old at that moment. Ever since, drawing has always been the best way for me to stay in touche with who I am and how I am.

I grew up since then, I am going though the second decade in my life.
Thanks to many encounters in my life, I developed many different hobbies.
I enjoy cooking and picked up photography a couple of years ago. (I like eating and stalking. omg. jk.) And maybe you guessed it already, I like playing video games!

### My idea behind this website
I had a really bad 2 year stop at drawing because, well, let's say I lost my touche... I believe that to improve my skills at anything, I need to be better at putting myself out there and discipline (lol). It's a laid back place in the internet where I can drag and drop things, so expect some humour, blog posts, and salt.
